This repo is just abunch of code that i put together to figure out how to revolve around roblox's API
it does not have port proxies, missed acan attributes, or cookie checkers. anything really, but still cool so check it out :)

it will not work unless you install my custom noblox since i made changes for it to work. should be in my github
